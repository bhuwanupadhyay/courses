# Learn Vocabularies

This is vocabulary for software development and architecture.

## Terms
- Architectural Fitness Function: A way to measure the quality of the architecture of a software system.
- Cohesion: What extent the parts of a module should be contained within the same module.
- Coupling: The extent to which the parts of a module depend on each other.
- Connascence: The extent to which the parts of a module are aware of each other.
- Modularity: The ability to break a system into smaller, more manageable pieces.
- Resiliency: The ability of a system to recover from failures.
- Chaos Engineering: The discipline of experimenting on a distributed system in order to build confidence in the system's capability to withstand turbulent conditions in production.
- Cyclomatic Complexity: A software metric used to indicate the complexity of a program.

## Tools
- JDepend: A tool for measuring the quality of Java code.
- Crap4J: A tool to measure cyclomatic complexity and code coverage of Java classes.
- ArchUnit: A Java library for writing unit tests that assert architectural rules.
- Chaos Monkey: A resiliency tool that helps applications tolerate random instance failures.
