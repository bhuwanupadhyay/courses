# Architectural Fitness Function

Architectural Fitness Function (AFF) is a concept that was introduced by [Michael Feathers](https://michaelfeathers.silvrback.com/) in his book [Working Effectively with Legacy Code](https://www.amazon.com/Working-Effectively-Legacy-Michael-Feathers/dp/0131177052). 
It is a way to measure the quality of the architecture of a software system.

Tools like [JDepend](http://www.jdepend.org/), [Crap4J](http://www.crap4j.org/), and [ArchUnit](https://www.archunit.org/) can be used to measure the quality of the architecture of a software system.
