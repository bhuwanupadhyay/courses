# Architecture Characteristics

Typically, the architecture of a system is described in terms of the following characteristics:

## Operational Characteristics

- Operational characteristics are the characteristics of the system that are related to the operations of the system. For example, the availability of the system, the performance of the system, the scalability of the system, the reliability of the system, the security of the system, the maintainability of the system, etc.
- These characteristics are also known as non-functional requirements.

## Availability

- Availability is the ability of the system to be accessible and usable by the users at any given time.
- Availability is measured in terms of the percentage of time that the system is available to the users.
- Availability is also known as uptime.

### How to measure availability?

- Availability can be measured by the following formula:

  ```text
  Availability = (Time the system is available) / (Total time)
  ```
- For example, if the system is available for 99.9% of the time, then the availability of the system is 99.9%.
